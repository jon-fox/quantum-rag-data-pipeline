1. 2-Day Aggregated Load Summary
Why: Core metric for daily demand.

Use: Report total and peak load, compare against previous day or forecast.

2. 2-Day Aggregated Generation Summary
Why: Supply-side total; check if generation met load.

Use: Detect generation shortfalls or excess.

3. 2-Day Aggregated Ancillary Service Offers ECRSS
Why: Indicates stress or grid contingency planning.

Use: Flag elevated offers as signs of tight reserve margins.

4. 2-Day Aggregated DSR Loads
Why: Shows demand-side response activity.

Use: Suggests ERCOT called for load reduction due to grid stress.

5. 2-Day Aggregated Output Schedule
Why: Planned vs. actual output indicator.

Use: Spot mismatches between scheduled and actual generation.

### üå§Ô∏è Weather Data Collection Strategy

To support statewide ERCOT load and generation forecasting, weather data is collected from major metropolitan areas representing each geographic region of the ERCOT grid. This ensures broad spatial coverage while minimizing data redundancy.

**Selected Cities by Region:**

* **North** ‚Äì Dallas, TX
* **South** ‚Äì San Antonio, TX
* **Central** ‚Äì Austin, TX
* **Coastal / Southeast** ‚Äì Houston, TX
* **West** ‚Äì El Paso, TX or Lubbock, TX
* *(Optional)* **Gulf Coast** ‚Äì Corpus Christi, TX

**Collected Variables (Hourly):**

* Temperature at 2 meters (`temperature_2m`)
* Relative humidity (`relative_humidity_2m`) *(optional but useful)*
* Precipitation (`precipitation`) *(optional if available)*

Data is pulled daily from a historical weather API (e.g., WeatherAPI or Open-Meteo) and averaged across locations to approximate overall ERCOT weather trends.

This data is then used to:

* Contextualize load/generation behavior
* Explain grid stress or reserve changes
* Feed into semantic summaries in the RAG pipeline

**Sample Summary (Statewide ERCOT, May 30‚Äì31, 2025):**
**Total Load & Generation:** On May 30, ERCOT reported an aggregated system load of **5341 MW** and telemetry generation of **5387 MW**.
**Ancillary Services:** ECRSS offers totaled **2.1 GW**, with pricing data recorded.
**Demand Side Resources:** DSR loads contributed **104 MW**. DSR generation values were also reported.
**Forecast Accuracy:** Output schedules were reported at **5400 MW**, with lower and upper bounds at **5300 MW** and **5500 MW** respectively. Basepoint generation was **5380 MW**, with high and low sustainable limits at **5450 MW** and **5300 MW**.
**Weather Conditions:** Average temperatures across major Texas cities on May 30 were as follows ‚Äî **Houston: 25.6¬∞C**, **Austin: 27.1¬∞C**, **San Antonio: 26.8¬∞C**, **Dallas: 23.3¬∞C**, **El Paso: 24.1¬∞C**.

May include later
**Weather Impact:** No major weather anomalies were recorded, supporting typical late spring demand trends.

**Notes on Summary Design:**

* Quantities are rounded and normalized (e.g., GWh for energy, ¬∞F for temperature).
* Summary focuses on system-wide energy balance, consumption, generation, and operational flexibility.
* Weather coverage is concise, highlighting only relevant temperature ranges across key regions.
* Summary avoids excessive detail and noise while retaining key metrics useful for forecasting.
* Easily extendable to include historical comparisons or trends.
